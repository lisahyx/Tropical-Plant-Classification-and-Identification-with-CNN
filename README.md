# Tropical Plant Classification and Identification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Overview
This folder contains code and resources for a project focused on tropical plant classification and identification using CNN. The project aims to develop models capable of accurately classifying different species of tropical plants based on images of their leaves and flowers.

## Experiments
Each experiment is organised into two files and labeled with the experiment number (e.g., Experiment 1 = Exp1_). These experiments include the training and testing of models.

## Datasets
The datasets used in the experiments can be accessed in the `/dataset` folder. These datasets comprise images and labels of tropical plants, meticulously curated and annotated for training and testing purposes. 
<br/>
Due to file size issues, the images files are removed from this folder and only the labels are retained. To view the complete images dataset, please navigate to the Google Drive Folder.

## Models
The trained models are saved in the `/models` folder. 

## Acknowledgements
This project was developed as part of an undergraduate final year dissertation report.
